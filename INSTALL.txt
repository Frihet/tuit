To install FreeTIL, run ./installation.sh in the current directory on
a Ubuntu Hardy or later. After installation, go to the web address of
your machine using your web browser, and log in as

Brukernavn: admin
Passord: freetil

Have fun!


Notes:

Do not make the same FreeTIL instance available using multiple domain
names - cookie / login handling will break if you do that. To resolve
issues originating from this, consider using Apaches Redirect or
Redirectmatch directives in conjucntion with VirtualHost:s.
