README for django-translations-supersedes for TUIT

This directory contains files that were used to supersede Norwegian
translations in the django project found to be lacking in quality for
TUIT.  The file django.new here is the result of msgmerge of newer,
better quality translations into the older django plus some edits.

In order to install the result in your django after any edit you need
to do the following:

a) edit django.new found in this directory.

b) copy the edited file to /usr/share/python-support/python-django/django/conf/locale/no/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
   and generate messages in the runtime format:

   $ cp django.new /usr/share/python-support/python-django/django/conf/locale/no/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
   $ cd /usr/share/python-support/python-django/django/conf/
   $ python /var/lib/python-support/python2.5/django/bin/make-messages.py -l no

c) check that your work appears in the product as expected
