<div class='help'>

<p>
This is the main help page for Tuit. Tuit is The Ultimate ITIL
Toolbox, a set of software components designed to support ITIL based
work flow for service management. Tuit currently consists of the
following components:

<ul>
<li><a href=''>An issue handling system</a>, based on <a href='http://roundup.sourceforge.net/'>Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href='/FreeCMDB/help'>A CMDB</a> based on FreeCMDB</li>
<li><a href=''>A knowledge base</a>, based on <a href='http://foswiki.org/'>Foswiki</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1><a name='overview'>User interface overview</a></h1>
<p>
  This section described the basic user interface concepts of
  Tuit. These concepts are the same in all components, e.g. the
  Knowledge base looks and works as much like the CMDB as is possible
  without compromising the functionality of either.
</p>

<h2><a name='overview_topmenu'>The top menu</a></h1>
<p>
  The top menu allows you to navigate to the different parts of the
  site. This menu does not usually change depending on what part of
  Tuit you are using, but because different users have access to
  different parts of the site, it will vary depending on who is logged
  in.
</p>
<p>
  The top menu also allows you to quickly search the system. Just
  enter a few keywords into the search box and press the «enter» key.For
  more information on searching, see <a href='#search'>the search
  section</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name='overview_leftmenu'>The left side menu</a></h1>
<p>
  The menu on the left side of every page contains page specific links
  and options. This menu will be different in e.g. the Knowledge base
  than in the CMDB.
</p>

<h2><a name='overview_content'>The main content area</a></h1>
<p>
  The remainder of the screen is called the main content area, this is
  where the main application data is shown. What the content area
  contains depends heavily on what page you are viewing.
</p>


<h1><a name='home'>The home screen</a></h1>
<p>
  This is the start page of Tuit. A future version of Tuit will
  contain a user configurable dashboard showing various status
  information and messages, but the current home screen is very
  limited. It contains the following items:
  <ul>
    <li>
      A list of all Incidents assigned to the logged in user, sorted by priority.
    </li>
    <li>
      A list of all Problems assigned to the logged in user, sorted by priority.
    </li>
    <li>
      A list of all RfCs assigned to the logged in user, sorted by priority.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h1><a name='search'>Searching Tuit</a></h1>
<p>
  Tuit contains a global search function that will search every
  component of Tuit. To quickly perform a search, enter a search word
  in the search box in the top right corner of any Tuit page, and then
  press the «enter» key.
</p>
<p>
  If a search yields many results, only the first ten results are
  shown, and the user may press a button in order to see more results.
</p>
<h2><a name='search_types'>Search types</a></h2>
<p>
  Tuit shows the following types of search results:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Issues</em>. This shows both Incidents, Problems and
      RfCs. Freetext searches the subject, the description, all
      updates as well as the name of the user who requested the
      issue. All advanced search options work.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>CIs</em>. This shows all matching items from the
      CMDB. Freetext searches the CI name. No advanced search options
      work.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Knowledge base articles</em>. This shows all matching items
      from the Knowledge base. Freetext searches title, the KB form
      and the KB text proper. No advanced search options work.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>User search</em>. This shows all matching users. Freetext
      searches the username, first and last name. No advanced search
      options work.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2><a name='search_advanced'>Advanced search</a></h2>
<p>
  To specify additional search options, click on the «Advanced search
  options» button in a search result page. There, issue priority,
  update date and other search criteria can be applied. Note that not
  all types of search filters apply to all search places, e.g. User
  search ignores all filters except the search text.
</p>


<h1><a name='issues'>Tuit Issue Management</a></h1>

<p>

  The Tuit issue handling component is an issue tracker loosely based
  on <a href='http://roundup.sourceforge.net/'>Roundup</a>. It is
  intended to be used to track Incidents, Problems and Requests for
  Change as they make their way through your IT organization.
  
</p>
<h2><a name='issues_types'>Types of issues</a></h2>
<p>
  Tuit is based around 3 types of issues:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Incidents</em> are issues that have caused or may in the
      future cause service interruptions, that need to be handled
      before breaching an SLA.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Problems</em> are issues that support root cause analysis of
      one or more incidents.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>RfCs</em> Or Requests for Change, are issues that track
      roll out of a change in a service, often triggered by a Problem.
    </li>
  </ul>  
</p>

<h2><a name='issues_creating'>Creating a new issue</a></h2>
<p>
For each <a href='#issues_types'>issue type</a> there is a
corresponding link in the top menu of Tuit for filing an issue of that
type. Use one of these links in order to file a new issue. You
will be presented with a form with various fields to fill out.
</p>
<p>
When done, click the «Create issue» button at the bottom of the page,
and you are done.
</p>
<h3><a name='issues_creating_user'>Filling out user fields</a></h3> 
<p>
  Issues have many users associated with them, including the raiser of
  the issue, the person assigned to a specific issue, etc.. Fields for
  filling out users in Tuit all use autocompletion. The autocompletion
  code will search the username, first name and last name of the user
  when performing the completion.
</p>
<p>
There are several variations on how user fields work:
<ul>
  <li>
    Some user fields only permit a single user, these text field for
    these fields is only one line long. Others permit arbitrarily many
    users. These text fields contain multiple lines.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some user fields only allow registered users to be entered, others
    also allow you to enter an email address. If you've added an email
    address once, it will be added into Tuit as a contact. When
    receiving an email about an issue, a contact is also
    created. These contacts are also used for autocompletion where
    appropriate, and they can also
    be <a href='/tuit/admin/ticket/contact/'>edited</a> in the
    <a href='#concepts_admin'>administration back end</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3><a name='issues_creating_issues'>Filling out dependencies to other issues</a></h3>
<p>
  Issues can depend on other issues. The field for changing issue
  dependencies uses autocompletion. The autocompletion code will search
  the issue subject, description and the text of all updates.
</p>

<h3><a name='issues_creating_ci'>Filling out dependencies to CIs</a></h3>
<p>
  Issues can depend on configuration items (CIs), that is, the items
  stored in the CMDB portion of Tuit.  The field for changing CI
  dependencies uses autocompletion. The autocompletion code will
  search the name of the CI. There is, however, also a second method
  for specifying a CI, the CMDB drill down feature. This is a tree of
  all known CIs, that can be selectively expanded to drill down
  through dependencies until the wanted one is
  found. See <a href='#cmdb_navigation'>for more information</a>.
</p>
<h3><a name='issues_creating_quickfills'>Using quick fills to automatically fill out common fields</a></h3>
<p>
  On many service desks, there is a great number of repetitive
  tickets. This can be caused by a common underlying problem that
  needs to be fixed or simply because users tend to run into the same
  types of problems. In order to simplify the creation of such
  repetitive issues, Tuit provides a feature called Quick fills. This
  is simply a drop down box with common issue «templates». Select one
  of them, and various fields will be automatically filled out for
  you. Exactly what fields are set to what values on every Quick fill
  can be changed in the <a href='#concepts_admin'>administration back end</a>.
</p>

<h4>Changing the available quick fills</h4>
<p>
  This action can only be performed by users with access rights to the
  admin back end. 

  {% if user.is_staff %}
  You currently have this right, and can perform the steps below if you wish. Keep in mind that your changes will apply for all users, not just yourself.
  {% else %}
  You currently do not have this right and can not perform the steps described below.
  {% endif %}

Quick fills are created using these steps:

  <ol>
    <li>First, enter the administration back end, by clicking the link at the top of the screen.</li>
    <li>First create a <em>Quick fill</em>. These only contain the description of what will be filled out.</li>
    <li>Once that has been done, create multiple <em>Quick fill items</em>. Each such item contains the quick fill this item applies to, the field which is filled out and the value to set the field to.</li>    </ol>
</p>

<h3><a name='issues_creating_copy'>Creating a new issue based on another issue</a></h3>
<p>
  It is also possible to create a new issue by basing it on another
  issue. Perform the following steps to create a new issue this way:
  <ol>
    <li>
      First go the the web page of the original
      issue. A link to the relevant page should be included in every email
      from the Tuit system, or you could find the update
      by <a href='#search'>searching Tuit</a> or browsing
      your <a href='#home'>home page</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once you are on the correct page, click the «Create new ticket
      based on this ticket» button at the top of the screen.
    </li>
    <li>
      This will show a tiny dialog on the screen where you will be
      asked what type of issue to create. Pick the desired issue type
      from the drop down box and press the «Create» button.
    </li>
    <li>
      The same issue creation form that is displayed when clicking one
      of the issue creation links in the top menu will now be shown,
      but with the following fields copied from the original issue:
      <ul>
	<li>Issue subject</li>
	<li>Description of the issue</li>
	<li>Issue category</li>
	<li>Impact of issue</li>
	<li>Urgency of issue</li>
	<li>Requester of issue</li>
	<li>User assigned to this issue</li>
	<li>People CC:ed on this issue</li>
	<li>Users who are co-responsible for this issue</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2><a name='issue_update'>Updating an issue</a></h2>
<p>
  There are two basic ways to update in issue. The first is through
  the web interface, the other is through email.
</p>
<h3><a name='issue_update_email'>Updating an issue through email</a></h3>
<p>
  In order to create an update through email, simple reply to an email
  sent from Tuit. The content of the email, including any attached
  files, will be added as an update to the issue. If the issue was
  closed, it will be reopened, but otherwise, no field values are
  changed.
</p>

<h3><a name='issue_update_web'>Updating an issue through the web</a></h3>
<p>
  Updating an issue through the web interface allows more fine grained
  control over an update. It is possible to change the values of all
  fields of an issue except the subject and the original problem
  description. It is possible to explicitly specify who should receive
  email notification of the update, and it is possible to make the
  update internal, e.g. hide it from non-privileged users.
</p>
<p>
  To update an issue, first go the the web page of that issue. A link
  to the relevant page should be included in every email from the Tuit
  system, or you could find the update by <a href='#search'>searching
  Tuit</a> or browsing your <a href='#home'>home page</a>. Once you
  are on the correct page, click the «Add new update» button at the
  bottom of the screen.

  For more
  information about changing specific types of fields, such as auto
  completing user name fields, <a href='#issues_creating'>see the
  section on creating issues</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name='issue_update_kb'>Using an issue update as the basis for a
knowledge base article</a></h3>

<p>
  When having solved an issue, it is sometimes desirable to make that
  solution available to others as a knowledge base article. This has
  the potential to greatly reduce the amount of time required to solve
  similar issues in the future. For this reason, Tuit makes it as easy
  as possible to perform this task. The following steps are all that
  is required:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Locate the issue containing the relevant update and scroll down to find the correct update.
  </li>

  <li>
    Click on the «Create KB article from this update» button.
  </li>

  <li>
    A small dialog is presented, allowing you to choose the name of
    the article (The default is the subject of the ticket) and to
    specify which section of the knowledge base to use. Press the
    «Submit» button once you are done.
  </li>

  <li>
    Fill out the Knowledge base article form and make any changes to
    the main article text that are needed. Press the «Save» button
    when you are done to create the Knowledge base article.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3><a name='issue_update_kb2'>Using a knowledge base article as the
  basis for an issue update</a></h3>

<p> A knowledge base is only useful if it is used. For this reason,
  Tuit makes it as easy as possible to use Knowledge base information
  when updating an issue. Below the text field for making an update
  comment, there is a text input field. When writing into this field,
  Tuit will search the Knowledge base, and show you
  an <a href='#concepts_autocompletion'>autocompletion</a> list of
  articles whose subject or content match that text. Once an article
  has been chosen, the user can either press the «Preview» button in
  order to see a preview of the article contents or press the «Insert»
  button in order to insert the article contents into the update.
</p>


<h2><a name='issue_email_templates'>Changing the content of emails sent by Tuit</a></h2>
<p>
  Tuit is designed to be usable either through the web interface or
  through email. When an issue is updated through email, an update is
  sent to the people assigned to that ticket. In the web interface,
  the user can specifically choose which parties should recive that
  particular update. But for Tuit to be able to send these emails, one
  must first specify template emails. This is done through
  the <a href='#concepts_admin'>administration interface</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Take the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Access <a href='/tuit/admin/'>the administration interface</a>.</li>
  <li>Click on the «change» link next to the item labeled <a href='/tuit/admin/ticket/emailtemplate/'>Email templates</a>.</li>
  <li>Select which template you wish to change</li>
  <li>Edit the template. The subject is in plaintext, the body is HTML formated. A future version of Tuit will include a graphical html editor.</li>
  <li>Click the save button</a>
</ol>
<p>
  In order to insert specific data about a ticket or an update, there are special tags, beginning with a percent symbol that will be replaced with the suitable text when sending the email. These are described in the table below.
</p>
<table class='striped'>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Tag
    </th>
    <th>
      Description
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      %%
    </td>
    <td>
      A single percent symbol.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      %(recipient.first_name)s
    </td>
    <td>
      The email recipients first name.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      %(recipient.last_name)s
    </td>
    <td>
      The email recipients last name.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      %(recipient.name)s
    </td>
    <td>
      The email recipients full name, first and last.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      %(recipient.username)s
    </td>
    <td>
      The email recipients username.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      %(issue.id)d
    </td>
    <td>
      The issue number for this issue.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      %(issue.url)s
    </td>
    <td>
      The URL containing the full information on this issue.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      %(issue.subject)s
    </td>
    <td>
      The subject for this issue.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      %(issue.description)s
    </td>
    <td>
      The main description for this issue.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      %(update.comment)s
    </td>
    <td>
      The comment for the latest update to this issue. This will be empty if
      the issue has never been updated, e.g. if the issue is only just
      being created.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  There are many users connected to an issue, including the original
  requester, the person who created the issue, the person who created
  an issue update, etc. These are all available, and all have the same
  fields available to them as the recipient does in the table
  above. For example, «%(issue.assigned_to.email)s» is the email address of
  the person assigned to fixing this issue. The list of available
  users are desbribed in the table below.
</p>

<table class='striped'>
  <tr>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

    </td>
    <td>
      The person who is assigned to solving this issue.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      %(update.creator)s
    </td>
    <td>
      The person who made the latest update to the issue.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h2><a name='issue_contact_admin'>Purging the contact list</a></h2>
<p>
  Whenever a person who is not a Tuit user is assigned as CC for an
  issue, or whenever a person sends an email to Tuit in relation to an
  issue, a contact entry for that person is created. This contact
  entry is used for e.g. autocompletion. Sometimes, it is desirable to
  purge old contact entries, in order to make the suggestions given by
  Tuit more relevant. To do this, take the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Access <a href='/tuit/admin/'>the administration interface</a>.</li>
  <li>Click on the «change» link next to the item labeled <a href='/tuit/admin/ticket/contact/'>External contacts</a>.</li>
  <li>Click on the contact you wish to remove</li>
  <li>Click the remove button</a>
</ol>

<h1><a name='cmdb'>Tuit CMDB</a></h1>

<h2><a name='cmdb_navigation'>Navigating the CMDB</a></h2>

<p>
  Usually, the easiest way to navigate the CMDB is through
  dependencies. The CMDB start page contains a list of suitable start
  nodes. Each of these nodes has a small button next to them with a +
  sign. Click on the plus to expand and show all nodes related to that
  node. Using this method repeatedly, it is possible to drill down
  until the desired CI is located. Then, simply click on the CI to
  access the main page of that CI.
</p>
<p>
  When like adding a new CI dependency, either in the CMDB or in the
  issue tracker, the same drilldown interface is also available.
</p>

<h3><a name='cmdb_navigation_root'>Changing the starting points of navigation in the CMDB</a></h3>
<p>
  In order to change the list of CIs displayed at the start of the
  drill down tree, simply update the dependencies of the CI called
  «Root».
</p>

<h2><a name='cmdb_create'>Creating and updating CIs</a></h2>
<p>
  Creating CIs is easy - simply press the «Create new item» button in
  the left side menu, and start editing the item. Updating an existing
  item can be done in two ways:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Press the «Update» button of an individual field on the CI to edit that field.
    </li>

    <li>
      Press the «Edit item» link in the left side menu to obtain a form
      where all fields of the CI can be edited at once.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2><a name='cmdb_history'>Using the history feature</a></h2>
<p>
  Every change ever performed to a CI is saved. To view the performed
  changes, follow the «History» link in the left side menu of a CI. A
  list of all changes will be displayed. To view a specific revision
  of a CI, you can click the ½Show» button next to that revision. It
  is also possible to revert all edits performed after a specific
  edit.
</p>

<h2><a name='cmdb_ci_types'>Configuring CI types</a></h2>
<p>
  The types of CIs (e.g. Server, Service, Firewall) that are available can be configured freely. Perform the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Access the administration interface.
    {% if user.is_staff %}
    It can be found <a href='/tuit/admin/'>here</a>.
    {% endif %}
  </li>
  <li>Click the CMDB Administration link.</li>
  <li>Click the sidebar item «CI types»</li>
  <li>Update the list of CI types as you require, and press «Update».</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name='cmdb_ci_types'>Configuring CI fields</a></h2>
<p>
  The fields availalbe to various CI types can be configured freely. Perform the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Access the administration interface.
    {% if user.is_staff %}
    It can be found <a href='/tuit/admin/'>here</a>.
    {% endif %}
  </li>
  <li>Click the CMDB Administration link.</li>
  <li>Click the sidebar item «CI columns»</li>
  <li>Update the list of CI columns as you require, and press «Update».</li>
</ol>
<p>
  It is strongly recommended that the default column (which is used
  for CI description, etc.) be of the unformated text type.
</p>


<h1><a name='kb'>Tuit Knowledge base</a></h1>

<h1><a name='concepts'>Tuit concepts</a></h1>

<h2><a name='concepts_autocompletion'>Autocompletion</a></h2>
<p>
  Autocompletion or automatic completion, is technique used in many
  places in Tuit. It is useful when picking between a very large
  selection of items, e.g. in situations where a drop down box is
  unsuitable, because the number of items in the list would be
  prohibitive. Autocompletion uses a simple text input field, where
  the user can enter text, and the entire list of items will be
  searched, and any matching items will be shown. The user can then
  use the up and down arrows to move around in the list and press the
  enter key to select the highlighted item.

<h2><a name='concepts_admin'>The administration back end</a></h2>
<p>
  The administration back end is the location where most of the
  configuration of Tuit is performed. It can be
  accessed <a href='/tuit/admin'>here</a>. Because Tuit consists of
  multiple separate components that all need to also work on their
  own, it is unfortunately not possible to create a single place for
  all configuration needs. When logged in as a user with
  administration permissions, a link to the admin back end should be
  available in the top menu.
